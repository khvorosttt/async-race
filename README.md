# Async Race

Your customer has an idea to spend his money. He has hired some engineers who installed radio-controlled equipment ðŸ“» in real cars ðŸš—, to be precise, all of his collection of cars. He is eager to create a kind of drag-racing competition in order to discover which car is the fastest.

Each radio controller has an HTTP-compatible interface. It lets you start or stop the engine of the car and, of course, enable "driving" mode.

This application is a SPA for managing a collection of cars, operating their engines and displaying racing statistics.

In order to test the operation of this application, you first need to run a local server, which can be downloaded from the [link](https://github.com/mikhama/async-race-api).
